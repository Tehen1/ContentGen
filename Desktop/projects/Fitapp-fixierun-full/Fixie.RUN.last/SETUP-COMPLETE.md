# Fixie.Run - Platform Setup Complete

## Project Overview

Fixie.Run is a blockchain-based Move-to-Earn (M2E) fitness application targeting cyclists, similar to the Zipline model. The platform rewards users with crypto tokens for physical activities, featuring NFT bikes that evolve based on usage, and implements a robust reward system verified through zero-knowledge proofs.

## Monorepo Setup Accomplishments

### Repository Structure
We've successfully established a monorepo architecture with three main packages:
- `frontend`: Next.js 15 application with Web3 integration
- `backend`: Express-based API with WebSocket support
- `contracts`: Smart contracts targeting Polygon zkEVM

### Key Technologies
- **Package Management**: Lerna with npm workspaces
- **TypeScript**: Shared configuration with path aliases for inter-package imports
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, wagmi, ethers, rainbowkit, mapbox-gl/react-map-gl
- **Backend**: Express, JWT, Socket.io, MongoDB/Mongoose, IPFS/Filecoin integration
- **Smart Contracts**: Hardhat, Polygon zkEVM, Solidity 0.8.x
- **Testing**: Jest, Mocha, Chai, Waffle
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows for testing, building, and deployment

### Core Components Implemented

#### Frontend
- Complete project structure with Next.js App Router
- Comprehensive styling with Tailwind CSS
- Environment configuration for Web3, API endpoints, and feature flags
- Layout and basic page structure

#### Backend
- Express server setup with middleware and error handling
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- MongoDB connection and configuration
- Environment validation using Zod
- Logging with Winston

#### Smart Contracts
- Core contracts developed:
  - `BikeNFT.sol`: ERC721 NFT with evolution mechanics
  - `FixieToken.sol`: Capped ERC20 token for rewards
  - `PedalToken.sol`: Governance ERC20 with voting capabilities
  - `Staking.sol`: Flexible staking with tiers and rewards
  - `ActivityVerifier.sol`: ZK proof integration for activity validation
- Deployment and verification scripts

#### DevOps & Tooling
- Comprehensive CI/CD pipelines for testing and deployment
- Environment configuration templates across all packages
- Git hooks with Husky for pre-commit checks
- Docker configuration for backend deployment

## Next Steps for Development

Based on our established development plan, here are the next priorities:

### Phase 1: Complete Integration (Current)
- [ ] Run the initialization script to set up Git repository
- [ ] Verify all package interdependencies work correctly
- [ ] Ensure CI/CD pipelines run successfully on initial commit

### Phase 2: Frontend Development
- [ ] Implement wallet connection components using wagmi
- [ ] Build dashboard UI with activity tracking visuals
- [ ] Develop map integration for ride tracking
- [ ] Create NFT visualization components
- [ ] Implement responsive design across all views

### Phase 3: Smart Contract Testing & Enhancement
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests for all contracts
- [ ] Implement integration tests for contract interactions
- [ ] Conduct security reviews and optimizations
- [ ] Deploy to Polygon zkEVM testnet for live testing

### Phase 4: Backend API Development
- [ ] Implement core API endpoints for user management
- [ ] Build activity tracking and verification services
- [ ] Create ZK proof generation and validation logic
- [ ] Implement IPFS integration for NFT metadata storage

### Phase 5: Full-Stack Integration
- [ ] Connect frontend to smart contracts via React hooks
- [ ] Integrate backend APIs with frontend
- [ ] Test end-to-end user flows
- [ ] Implement proper error handling across the stack

### Phase 6: Feature Development
- [ ] Implement GPS-based activity tracking
- [ ] Build leaderboards and social features
- [ ] Develop governance UI for token holders
- [ ] Create community challenges system

## Getting Started

To begin development on this project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the initialization script:
   ```bash
   ./init-repo.sh
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm run bootstrap
   ```
4. Copy and configure environment files:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   cp packages/frontend/.env.example packages/frontend/.env.local
   cp packages/backend/.env.example packages/backend/.env
   cp packages/contracts/.env.example packages/contracts/.env
   ```
5. Start development servers:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Documentation

Each package contains its own detailed README with specific instructions for:
- Setup and configuration
- Available scripts
