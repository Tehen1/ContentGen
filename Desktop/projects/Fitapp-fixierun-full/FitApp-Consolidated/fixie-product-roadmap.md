## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Approach
- Use agile methodology with 2-week sprints
- Prioritize features within each phase based on dependency chains
- Maintain separate development, staging, and production environments
- Implement continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)

### Technical Stack Considerations
- Frontend: React/Next.js with TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js with Express or Nest.js
- Blockchain: Polygon zkEVM for scaling and lower gas fees
- Smart Contracts: Solidity with OpenZeppelin libraries
- Data Storage: Hybrid approach with on-chain (NFTs, tokens) and off-chain (activity data) storage
- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 + Web3 wallet authentication

### Quality Assurance
- Unit and integration testing for all features
- Smart contract auditing before mainnet deployment
- Beta testing program for each phase before public release
- Performance benchmarking for real-time features
